I am a graduate student at MIT advised by Professor Zhiwei Yun since 2023. I obtained my bachelor's degree from Peking University.

My research interest is in geometric representation theory, especially the Langlands program. Recently, I have been working on the intersection theory of special cycles on Shtukas.
