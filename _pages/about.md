I am a third-year graduate student at MIT. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Zhiwei Yun. I obtained my bachelor's degree frmo Peking University.

My research interest is in geometric representation theory, especially the Langlands program. Recently, I have been working on the intersection theory of special cycles on Shtukas.

#Preprints

1. Special Cycle on Shtukas and Categorical Trace.

2. Higher Period Integrals and Derivatives of L-functions (joint with Shurui Liu), preprint on
arXiv, https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00275.

4. Appendix to "On the relative Langlands duality for Sp2n\GL2n+1" by Guodong Xi and Weix-
iao Lu, preprint on arXiv, https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2504.18774.
